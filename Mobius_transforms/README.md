This was a research project I conducted while I was in CEGEP

  ->  The goal was to chose a topic, then research it in depth over the course of nearly a year.
  ->  The end goal of the project was to produce a paper that introduces a general audience to the chosen topic.
  ->  Included in this directory is the excel spreadsheet I used for all my calculations as well as produce all my graphs.
  ->  As well as the paper itself.
